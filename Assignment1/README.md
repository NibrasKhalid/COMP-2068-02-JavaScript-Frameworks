# Express Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio site built with Node.js, Express, and Handlebars (HBS). It's designed to show off my projects and skills used in them as a future web developer and programming analyst.

The goal of this project was to create something clean, responsive, and professional where I could share who I am, what Iâ€™ve worked on, and how to get in touch. I used Bootstrap 5 to help make this site.
## Description
The goal of this website is to showcase my skills and projects i worked on as a Computer Programmer. The website includes four main pages:
- Home: A brief introduction and overview
- About: A detailed look into my background and interests
- Projects: Descriptions and links to selected projects
- Contact: A contact form and social links for professional outreach
